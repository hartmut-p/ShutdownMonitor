This software installs a clean shutdown to the Venus OS menu system.
The ShutdownMonitor runs as a service and creates a dbus service with a single
paramter: /Shutdown. Setting /Shutdown to 1 will trigger a clean OS shutdown.

A shutdown submenu is added to the Settings / General menu.
A submenu is used to alert the user that a power cycle is needed to restart the GX device.

Note that Cerbo restarts itself after a shutdown so this addition may not be useful
in all situations.

Setup:

The easiest way to install this or other of my packages is to first install SetupHelper,
then use its package install tool. Refer to the SetupHelper ReadMe for instructions.
