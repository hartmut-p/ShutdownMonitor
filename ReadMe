This software installs a clean shutdown to the Venus OS menu system.
The ShutdownMonitor runs as a service and creates a dbus service with a single
paramter: /Shutdown. Setting /Shutdown to 1 will trigger a clean OS shutdown.

A shutdown submenu is added to the Settings / General menu.
A submenu is used to alert the user that a power cycle is needed to restart the GX device.

Note that Cerbo restarts itself after a shutdown so this addition may not be useful
in all situations.

Setup:

The easiest way to install this or other of my packages is to first install SetupHelper,
then use its package install tool. Refer to the SetupHelper ReadMe for instructions.

There are two other methods to fetch a package archive.

wget -qO - https://github.com/kwindrem/ShutdownMonitor/archive/current.tar.gz | tar -xzf - -C /data

If not, do the following a computer that does have internet access

click on this link in a web browser:
https://github.com/kwindrem/ShutdownMonitor/archive/current.tar.gz

rename the resulting .tar.gz file to venus-data.tar.gz
copy the venus-data.tar.gz to a USB stick,
put the stick in the Venus device and reboot.
When Venus boots, it will unarchive the file to /data/TankRepeater-current

Repeat the above for SetupHelper if you haven't done so for another package

When you have the two -current direcotries from either of the above methods,
run the following commands

rm -rf /data/ShutdownMonitor
mv /data/ShutdownMonitor-current /data/ShutdownMonitor
rm -rf /data/ShutdownMonitor
mv /data/ShutdownMonitor-current /data/ShutdownMonitor
/data/ShutdownMonitor/setup

You will need root access to the Venus device. Instructions can be found here:
https://www.victronenergy.com/live/ccgx:root_access
The root password needs to be reentered following a Venus update.
Setting up an authorization key (see documentation referenced above) will save time and avoid having to reset the root password after each update.
